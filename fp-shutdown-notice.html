            Hello Friend,
        </p>
        <p>I'm sorry to tell you that the Facepunch forums are now closed.</p>

        <p>
            Thank you to everyone that has worked to make the community better. 
            There have been too many people over the years to list individually but 
            Hezzy has definitely worked harder for you guys than anyone else (including me) - 
            so thank you Hezzy for everything you've done for us.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some of the community have started a new forum to host the Facepunch Refugees - 
            if you need a new home <a style="color: #bbb;" href="https://knockout.chat/">please give them a visit</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's not lost on me that this forum has been a part of people's lives for nearly 15 years. 
            It's been a place where friendships have been made and personalities have been defined.
            I've always acted like you were a pain in my ass, but always been proud of you.
        </p>
